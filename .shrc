# Common Shell Configuration #
##############################
#
# `~/.shrc` is a common shell configuration for the Bourne shell (`sh(1)`) and
# Bourne compatible shells (`bash(1)`, `ksh(1)`, `ash(1)`, ...).
#
# This file should be executed first by the shell.

# umask
# =====
# Default `umask` is set to `0027`, i.e., `0750` (`drwxr-x---`) permissions for
# directories and `0640` (`-rw-r-----`) permissions for files.
umask 0027

# less
# ====
# `less` options are also taken from the environment variable `LESS` to avoid
# typing `less -options ...` each time `less` is invoked.
#
# -Q or --QUIET or --SILENT
# Causes totally "quiet" operation: the terminal bell is never rung.
# If the terminal has a "visual bell", it is used in all cases where the
# terminal bell would have been rung.
#
# -R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
# Like `-r`, but only ANSI "color" escape sequences are output in "raw" form.
# Unlike `-r`, the screen appearance is maintained correctly in most cases.
# ANSI "color" escape sequences are sequences of the form:
#         ESC [ ... m
# where  the "..."  is zero or more color specification characters For the
# purpose of keeping track of screen appearance, ANSI color escape sequences
# are assumed to not move the cursor. You can make less think that characters
# other than "m" can end ANSI color escape sequences by setting the
# environment variable `LESSANSIENDCHARS` to the list of characters which can
# end a color escape sequence. And you can make less think that characters other
# than the standard ones may appear between the ESC and the m by setting the
# environment variable `LESSANSIMIDCHARS` to the list of characters which can
# appear.
export LESS="$LESS --QUIET --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS"

# PATH
# ====
# Note: the tilde (`~`) is part of a shell expansion. The `$HOME` variable is
#       exportable and can be used independent of a specific shell.

# Include user's private `bin` to `PATH` if it exists.
if [ -d "${HOME}/bin" ]
then
    PATH="${HOME}/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Include user's private `.local/bin` to `PATH` if it exists.
if [ -d "${HOME}/.local/bin" ]
then
    PATH="${HOME}/.local/bin:$PATH"
fi

# Configuration for interactive shell
# ===================================
# If not running interactively, don't do anything.
# Note: `$-` prints the current set of options in the current shell.
#       `i` is in the set if current shell is interactive.
case $- in
    *i*) ;;
    *) return;;
esac

# Make `less` more friendly for non-text input files (see `lesspipe(1))`.
if command -v lesspipe > /dev/null
then
    eval "$(SHELL=/bin/sh lesspipe)"
fi

# Define some aliases.
if [ -f "${HOME}/.sh_aliases" ]
then
    . "$HOME/.sh_aliases"
fi
